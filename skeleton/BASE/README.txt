MinUI Zero is a performance-focused fork of MinUI for the TrimUI Brick and TrimUI Smart Pro. Runs cool, sleeps deep, lasts longer — same simple MinUI, tuned underneath, every change measured on real hardware.

----------------------------------------
What's different

  Closed-loop governor  the lowest clock that holds frame rate, per game — never overclocks
  GPU-dark menu         the launcher renders in software so the GPU powers down (Brick only)
  Zero idle waste       no polling daemons, radios and LEDs off, audio closed in sleep, USB charge-only
  Deep sleep            on by default — suspends to RAM, wakes instantly (opt-out tool included)
  Stock bugs fixed      NES ran hot with crackling audio, quit menus hung, LEDs re-lit themselves
  Plays better          stutter-free panel-locked pacing, a frame less input lag, smoother audio
  Tuned everything      cores built for the chip and pinned
  Hard to break         bad-ROM bail, mid-game resolution changes, crash-safe saves

About 7.5 hours on Game Boy (measured on the Brick) — up from about 6 before tuning.

There is no CPU Speed setting: the governor measures each game's real frame rate every half second and finds the lowest clock that verifiably holds it. The machine answers that question better than a menu can.

----------------------------------------
Installing

Only the TrimUI Brick and TrimUI Smart Pro are supported.

Use a reputable SD card, freshly formatted as FAT32 (MBR). Preload the "Bios" and "Roms" folders (see below), then copy everything in this zip — the "trimui" folder, "MinUI.zip" (without unzipping), "Bios", "Roms", "Saves", and this README — to the root of the card. Insert the card and power on; MinUI Zero installs automatically.

----------------------------------------
Updating

Copy a newer "MinUI.zip" (without unzipping) to the root of the SD card and power on. It updates in place; your roms, saves, and settings are untouched.

----------------------------------------
Shortcuts

  Brightness: MENU + VOLUME UP or VOLUME DOWN
  Sleep: POWER
  Wake: POWER
  Mute: FN switch

----------------------------------------
Sleep, quicksave & auto-resume

A short press of POWER sleeps the device. After two minutes asleep it suspends to RAM: the device goes fully cold and wakes instantly right where you left off. To disable suspend, run the "Deep Sleep" tool in the Tools menu — sleep then behaves like stock MinUI and the device powers off on a timer instead.

MinUI creates a quicksave when powering off in-game and resumes from it automatically on the next boot.

----------------------------------------
Roms

The "Roms" folder contains a folder for each console. You can rename these folders but you must keep the uppercase tag in parentheses — it maps the folder to the correct emulator (eg. "Nintendo (FC)" or "Famicom (FC)" both work).

When two folders share a display name (eg. "Game Boy Advance (GBA)" and "Game Boy Advance (MGBA)") they combine into a single menu item, letting you open specific roms with an alternate pak.

----------------------------------------
Bios

Some emulators require or run better with official bios files. MinUI Zero is strictly BYOB. Place each system's bios in the "Bios" folder under the matching tag (eg. PlayStation bios goes in "/Bios/PS/").

Bios file names are case-sensitive:

   FC: disksys.rom
   GB: gb_bios.bin
  GBA: gba_bios.bin
  GBC: gbc_bios.bin
   MD: bios_CD_E.bin
       bios_CD_J.bin
       bios_CD_U.bin
   PS: psxonpsp660.bin

----------------------------------------
Disc-based games

Place bin/cue (and/or iso/wav) files in a folder named after the cue file; MinUI launches the cue directly instead of opening the folder, eg.

  Harmful Park (English v1.0)/
    Harmful Park (English v1.0).bin
    Harmful Park (English v1.0).cue

For multi-disc games, put every disc in one folder and add an m3u file (a text file listing each disc's cue on its own line) named after the folder, eg. a "Policenauts" folder:

  Policenauts (English v1.0)/
    Policenauts (English v1.0).m3u
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 1).bin
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 1).cue
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 2).bin
    Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 2).cue

The m3u contains just:

  Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 1).cue
  Policenauts (Japan) (Disc 2).cue

With a multi-disc game, the in-game menu's Continue item shows the current disc; press left or right to switch. chd and official pbp files are also supported (multi-disc pbp over 2GB is not). All discs of a game share the same memory card and save-state slots.

----------------------------------------
Collections

A collection is a text file of full rom paths, one per line, living in "/Collections/" at the card root, eg. "/Collections/Metroid series.txt":

  /Roms/GBA/Metroid Zero Mission.gba
  /Roms/GB/Metroid II.gb
  /Roms/SNES (SFC)/Super Metroid.sfc
  /Roms/GBA/Metroid Fusion.gba

----------------------------------------
Display names

Override a file's display name by creating a map.txt in the same folder: one line per file, "rom.ext" then a single tab then "Display Name". Start the display name with "." to hide the file, eg.

  neogeo.zip	.Neo Geo Bios
  mslug.zip	Metal Slug

----------------------------------------
Simple mode

MinUI Zero has a simple mode that hides the Tools folder and replaces Options with Reset in the in-game menu — perfect for handing off to kids. Create an empty file named "enable-simple-mode" (no extension) in "/.userdata/shared/".

----------------------------------------
Advanced

A user-authored shell script named "auto.sh" in "/.userdata/tg5040/" runs on every boot. Use Unix line-endings.

Thanks

MinUI Zero stands on MinUI by Shaun Inman — the launcher, the frontend, and the philosophy are his, as are the thanks owed to the wider community documented in upstream MinUI. Deep sleep was ported from zhaofengli's MinUI branch; techniques were borrowed from MyMinUI (Turro75) and NextUI (LoveRetro); the rate-control idea comes from RetroArch. MinUI Zero is an independent fork, not affiliated with or endorsed by any of them.
