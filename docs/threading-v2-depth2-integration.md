# Threading v2 — depth-2 integration design (the Codex review artifact)

**Status:** design, pre-implementation. This is the plan to hand Codex before any code or
device time. Depth-1 is COMPLETE and on-device-validated (D52–D59); WP2 (the `run()` snapshot-
delivery contract) is committed (D60). This doc covers the **remaining** work: turning the serial
depth-1 rendezvous into the depth-2 **pipeline** that is the actual energy win.

# REVISION 4 — post-Codex round 3 (2026-07-15)

Round 3 confirmed D-f/D-h/D-i/D-j "implementable as written" (governor lifecycle, terminal
poweroff, save-identity, frame OOM — CLOSED). It found the remaining P0s in D-a…D-d, including a
real architectural error in D-a and an overclaim in D-d (a table I described but never wrote).
Both accepted. Rev-4 corrects them.

**D-a REVERTED — ordered frame events + bounded pool, NOT coalesce-at-RUN_DONE (fixes R3-F1/R3-F2).**
Round-3 F1 is correct: presenting once at RUN_DONE breaks the command/frame ordering contract (a
`SET_GEOMETRY` emitted after a frame would apply, during stream drain, before that frame's deferred
present). The coalescing shortcut is abandoned. Restore the straightforward v2.4 design: **each
`video_refresh` emits an ordered `FR_EV_FRAME` carrying its own pool-buffer id; MAIN presents each
frame IN STREAM ORDER inside the drain callback** (so a command before a frame applies before its
present, a command after applies after — ordering preserved by construction). Storage: a **bounded
frame-buffer pool** (`depth` + a small spill for multi-`video_refresh` epochs); each published frame
owns its buffer until MAIN presents and returns it; pool exhaustion drops the frame (FRAME payload is
droppable by contract). This also fixes R3-F2 for free: the buffer id rides the FRAME payload (no
`gen % depth` coupling, no need to carry a slot through RUN_DONE), and **`FR_DRAIN_DISCARD` already
skips `FR_EV_FRAME`** — so a discard park never presents a canceled frame and never advances the
last-presented visual gen V. Outcome FRAME/DUP/NONE stays via `tl_ep_frames`/`fc_signal_dup`; NULL
`video_refresh` routes to `fc_signal_dup` (DUP), and MAIN re-presents the MAIN-owned last-presented
immutable frame for DUP/NONE. The integration drain callback receives the drain **mode** so it can
assert it is never asked to present under DISCARD.

**D-b EXTENDED — bootstrap & teardown phases must use REAL drains (fixes R3-F3).** Two gaps: (1)
`fc_boot_stage` routes CORE service products through `fc_noop_cb` (frontend_core.c:157) — so a typed
command emitted during `retro_init`/`load_game` (options, input descriptors, geometry) is never
applied or freed → leak + lost state. Fix: bootstrap stages pass the **real integration drain
callback**, and Category-3 bootstrap setters route through the bootstrap-service stream. (2) Terminal
cleanup runs `unload_game`/`deinit` after stop with no phase and no MAIN drain — a callback emitted
there routes as `FCP_NONE` (wrong direct path) or into a service stream MAIN no longer drains (leak/
deadlock). Fix: add phase **`FCP_TEARDOWN_SVC`**; run callback-emitting `unload`/`deinit` as
drain-driven services **before** stop, keep MAIN draining until they ack, then stop → observe
STOPPED → join. The CORE-TLS phase is set/restored by the engine immediately around every vtable op,
so it is never stale across the RUN↔SVC↔TEARDOWN boundaries.

**D-c COMMAND OWNERSHIP STATE MACHINE (fixes R3-F4).** `CORE_OWNED → EVENT_OWNED → FREED`:
- `fr_core_emit` returning **FR_OK transfers ownership** to the ring (EVENT_OWNED).
- `fr_core_emit` returning **FR_ABORT ALSO transfers ownership** — a persistent command is retained
  in the CORE-local overflow ledger and flushed to MAIN before RUN_DONE. The wrapper must NOT treat
  FR_ABORT as failure-and-free (that is the use-after-free + double-free Codex found).
- CORE frees only on a result that proves no event/overflow entry was created.
- MAIN frees **exactly once**, after the apply callback returns. Successful park/terminal drainage
  therefore leaves nothing for a second cleanup sweep (no double-free).
- Persistent-command allocation failure must **fail-closed / terminate** before CORE proceeds —
  returning false while silently losing already-applied core state is not acceptable. Fail-closed
  paths may intentionally leak at process exit (matches the existing contract).

**D-d THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT-CALLBACK INVENTORY (fixes R3-F5).** Built from the 36 handled cases in
minarch.c's `environment_callback`. Grouped by routing rule:

- **Cat-1 Synchronous getters** — answered ON CORE from epoch-stable data (the core blocks on the
  return, so they can NOT be async-routed to MAIN): `GET_OVERSCAN`, `GET_CAN_DUPE`,
  `GET_SYSTEM_DIRECTORY`, `GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY`, `GET_VARIABLE`, `GET_VARIABLE_UPDATE`,
  `GET_LOG_INTERFACE`, `GET_INPUT_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES`, `GET_AUDIO_VIDEO_ENABLE`,
  `GET_INPUT_BITMASKS`, `GET_CORE_OPTIONS_VERSION`, `GET_DISK_CONTROL_INTERFACE_VERSION`. Rule: read
  only state immutable during an epoch (paths + option values are fixed at bootstrap/menu, and menu =
  park, so no mid-epoch mutation). No copy, no command.
  - **HAZARD `GET_CURRENT_SOFTWARE_FRAMEBUFFER`** — hands the core a render target. At depth-2 it must
    return a **credit-owned pool buffer**, never the shared `screen`, or CORE renders into a
    MAIN-owned/aliased surface.
- **Cat-2 Registration** (bootstrap; store a callback pointer, no MAIN state): `SET_DISK_CONTROL_
  INTERFACE`, `SET_DISK_CONTROL_EXT_INTERFACE`, `SET_FRAME_TIME_CALLBACK`, `SET_AUDIO_CALLBACK`,
  `GET_RUMBLE_INTERFACE`. (Our shipped cores don't drive `SET_AUDIO_CALLBACK`; if one did, who invokes
  it and when is out-of-scope for this bring-up and must be scoped separately.)
- **Cat-3 Bootstrap setters of MAIN-owned state** — emitted during init/load_game on CORE → route via
  the **bootstrap-service** stream (D-b), deep-copied, applied+freed on MAIN: `SET_PIXEL_FORMAT`,
  `SET_INPUT_DESCRIPTORS`, `SET_VARIABLES`, `SET_CORE_OPTIONS`, `SET_CORE_OPTIONS_INTL`,
  `SET_CONTROLLER_INFO`, `SET_CONTENT_INFO_OVERRIDE`, `SET_SUPPORT_NO_GAME`, `SET_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL`.
  Deep-copy shape: option definitions carry nested key/value/description strings + arrays → copy the
  whole tree.
- **Cat-4 Runtime setters** — emitted during retro_run on CORE → **RUN command** stream, ordered,
  deep-copied: `SET_GEOMETRY` (ordered, applies at its stream position — the ordering D-a-revert
  preserves), `SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO` (RUN command + **BARRIER**: MAIN applies, CORE waits),
  `SET_MESSAGE` (copy string), `SET_VARIABLE` (copy key/value), `SET_CORE_OPTIONS_DISPLAY`,
  `SHUTDOWN` (→ quit via atomic/event; terminal, no further grant).
- **Cat-5 Rumble invocation** — the core calls the registered rumble callback during retro_run →
  **ordered stream command, NOT a coalescing atomic** (an on→off pulse must survive to the motor);
  MAIN applies in order.

**D-g AUDIO CANCELLATION EDGE (fixes R3-F6).** Add a per-epoch, acquire-loaded **cancellation token**;
include it in `SND_batchSamples`' ring-space wait predicate and **wake the SND wait on park/stop**
(waking framering's producer condvar does NOT wake a separate SND wait — that was the residual park
stall). Accepted samples are published as **one atomic prefix commit** (bytes written before the
write index is release-published once); shortfall counts only cancellation-rejected units;
`fr_core_run_done(outcome, shortfall)` carries it (currently hardcoded 0 — engine touch). A park
landing mid-copy is safe iff the callback either commits the completed prefix and returns k, or
publishes nothing and returns 0 — it must never expose written-but-unpublished samples; later batch
calls after cancellation return 0 without touching the ring.

**D-k SLOT-RETURN ASSERTIONS (from R3-F8).** `fr_core_wait_grant` gains an output-only `out_slot`:
write it only when returning FR_GRANT (unspecified on PARK/STOP); assign after acquiring the
published grant; assert `slot < depth`, `slot_owned` contains slot, `snap[slot].gen == gen`; preserve
slot ownership through the RUN_DONE drain callback; prohibit slot reuse before the callback returns
and depth resize until every slot is reclaimed. With D-a-revert the frame reaches MAIN via the FRAME
payload, so RUN_DONE need NOT also carry the slot — `out_slot` serves only CORE's pool indexing.

**D-e status: D61 LANDED** (DECISIONS.md) — MAIN owns the governor (contract-aligned to shipped
reality; the tick already runs on MAIN, `Gov_start` is init-only), CORE publishes work samples, gen
from drained RUN_DONE, plus the round-3 governor-window hardening. Resolves R3-F7.

**Convergence:** round 1 = 13, round 2 = 11, round 3 = 8. D-f/D-h/D-i/D-j implementable; D-a…D-d and
D-g now corrected/specified and D61 landed. Round 4 should confirm the D-a revert closes the ordering
+ discard + slot-transport trio, the ownership FSM is leak/double-free-free across all paths, the env
table is complete, and the audio cancellation edge is race-free.

# REVISION 3 — post-Codex round 2 (2026-07-15)

Round 2 CLOSED 7 round-1 findings (F1, F2-sleep, F3-pacer, F10-sig, F11, F12-init, F13); marked
F4/F5/F8/F9 partial and F6-multicallback/F7-inventory unresolved; added 11 new (6×P0). All
accepted. Rev-2 left several as "either/or" or "reconcile" — **rev-3 makes the decisions.**
Supersedes rev-2 where noted.

**D-a. One present per epoch (closes F1/F6 multi-callback).** MAIN presents at most once per epoch,
at RUN_DONE. Multiple `video_refresh` calls in one `core.run` coalesce into the single credit
buffer (last wins); outcome = FRAME if ≥1 non-null copy else DUP/NONE. MAIN presents the credit
buffer for FRAME, or re-presents the MAIN-owned last-presented immutable frame for DUP/NONE. No
per-callback frame events, no spill buffers — one buffer per credit suffices because there is
exactly one present per epoch (intermediate sub-frames are never independently shown).

**D-b. CORE execution-phase marker (closes F3, enables F5 routing).** Replace the
`zero_ftv2_on_core` bool with a CORE-TLS phase enum set at CORE-thread entry and moved by the
engine: `FCP_BOOTSTRAP_SVC` / `FCP_RUN_EPOCH` / `FCP_RUNTIME_SVC` / `FCP_NONE`. Every frontend
callback routes by phase: RUN_EPOCH→run stream, *_SVC→service stream, FCP_NONE→legacy direct
(MAIN menu redraw). Fixes callbacks raised during retro_init/load_game/unserialize that today see
the bool as 0 and wrongly take the MAIN path.

**D-c. Typed command objects + ownership (F2/F5).** A command crosses as a typed, versioned heap
object; its pointer rides `fr_event.payload`. CORE deep-copies the libretro payload *including
nested strings* (SET_VARIABLE key/value) at emit; MAIN applies in ring order in the drain cb and
frees after apply returns; alloc-failure = drop (droppable) or fail-closed (persistent), per type;
park/discard/terminal paths free undrained command objects (MAIN owns the free). Emission is
phase-aware (D-b): RUN via `fc_emit_cmd`, *_SVC via `fr_core_service_emit` — `fc_emit_cmd` during a
service op would assert (no open epoch), so AV/geometry emitted during unserialize/reset take the
service path with a service-side barrier wait.

**D-d. Full environment-callback inventory (F9).** rev-3 carries a table: every env callback →
{owner, copy policy, RUN/SVC route, persistence/barrier, return}. Covers SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO,
SET_GEOMETRY, SET_VARIABLE(S), SET_CORE_OPTIONS(_INTL), SET_INPUT_DESCRIPTORS, SET_MESSAGE,
SHUTDOWN, rumble, … **Rumble is an on→off pulse — a latest-value atomic can erase it**, so rumble
is an ordered stream command (not a coalescing atomic); MAIN applies to the motor in order. Same-
epoch geometry/AV ordering is sound via the existing ordered stream (cmd-before-frame applies
before; cmd-after applies after; AV barrier releases only after MAIN's apply returns).

**D-e. MAIN owns the governor (F4) — amend v2.4 via D-log (D61).** The pure-producer correction
wins over v2.4's "governor on CORE": MAIN owns GovState + cpufreq application; CORE publishes
immutable per-epoch work samples into the ring; MAIN derives generation rate from drained RUN_DONE
and sets the clock. Amended into the contract by a DECISIONS entry at implementation, not left as
two conflicting contracts.

**D-f. Governor window lifecycle (F8).** gen = drained RUN_DONE that entered retro_run (DUP/NONE
included — completed runs; queued-canceled grants excluded — no RUN_DONE). Reset/freeze the rate
window at park, release, and every depth transition (symmetric — no stale history across modes). FF
comes from each epoch's control snapshot, never live. The depth predicate flips only while
QUIESCENT inside the depth-change gate.

**D-g. Audio shortfall plumbing (F5) — touches the engine.** CORE-local per-epoch shortfall
accumulator; the audio callback publishes exactly the accepted prefix, never internally retries the
rejected suffix, accumulates n−k once, returns 0 promptly after cancellation. frontend_core passes
the accumulated shortfall to `fr_core_run_done(outcome, shortfall)` (currently hardcoded 0).
Re-run plain/TSan/ASan after the engine touch.

**D-h. Terminal poweroff flow (F6).** The long-press `before_sleep()→PWR_powerOff()` path
(api.c:1780) gets its own sequence: park → drain → CORE save/autosave/memory-flush services →
stop/join (terminal quiescence) → close audio → poweroff. No release, no subsequent grant.

**D-i. State gen G + snapshot V (F7).** G = highest drained RUN_DONE gen that actually entered
retro_run (include a completed CANCELLED active epoch; exclude canceled queued grants). Freeze V
(the MAIN-owned last-presented frame's visual gen) after normal park drainage, before any
serialize-service callback can change presentation. Save the pair (state G, snapshot V) while
parked; terminal save-and-quit does not release CORE.

**D-j. Frame OOM / runtime growth (F10).** Size credit buffers from validated AV
`geometry.max_width`/`max_height` + pixel format (not the first frame's size), so well-behaved
cores never exceed capacity. If a frame still exceeds: do not write/publish stale pixels; drop the
frame; publish a MAIN resize request (a command); finish the epoch; MAIN parks and resizes the pool
or falls back to depth-1 via the gate (CORE cannot invoke the gate from inside video_refresh).

**D-k. WP-G signature reopens engine API (round-2 WP-G audit).** `run(ctx, gen, slot, snapshot)`
requires `fr_core_wait_grant` to also return `slot` → touches framering.{h,c}, frontend_core.{h,c},
and the harness fake run: a controlled reopening of reviewed engine surface, re-verified under
plain/TSan/ASan.

**D-l. F23 service inventory is mandatory-before-release (F11).** Codex's refinement accepted:
prioritizing below F1–F6 is fine for bring-up *sequencing* but is NOT optional — real unsafe paths
exist (a core reading retro_init/run TLS during serialize; serialize/unserialize emitting video/env
callbacks, which the v2.4 service contract permits; a disc callback assuming the core thread).
Complete the service routing (memory flush, disc replace, controller change, save/load/reset,
callback-emitting services) before the save/load/menu gauntlet and before release.

**Convergence:** round 1 = 13, round 2 = 11 (7 of round-1 closed). Trending like the v2.4 contract
(5 rounds: 15→7→6→4→0). Round 3 should confirm these decisions close the P0s and attack the
command-object protocol (D-c), the phase machine (D-b), and the governor-ownership amendment (D-e).

# REVISION 2 — post-Codex adversarial review (2026-07-15)

Codex reviewed rev-1 at commit b2858858 and returned 13 findings (8×P0, 5×P1). Spot-checked
against source and accepted: F1 (CORE calls `GFX_clearAll` + mutates global `renderer` on resize,
minarch.c:3196+), F2 (`PWR_update → Menu_beforeSleep → State_autosave` enters the core, 1959→3604),
F6 (NULL early-return, no `fc_signal_dup`, 3305) — all as cited. Rev-1 was frame+input scoped and
under-specified the command channel, the sleep/power core-entry, the depth-2 pacer, the governor
gen-signal, and frame-descriptor immutability. **This revision supersedes rev-1 where noted; the
rev-1 body is retained below for the review trail.**

## Corrected architecture principle: CORE is a PURE PRODUCER

The CORE thread does exactly three things per epoch: (1) run `core.run()`, (2) **copy** each frame
into a credit-owned buffer and publish an **immutable descriptor**, (3) emit audio + commands into
the ring. It applies **nothing**. Every application of state — renderer/scaler selection,
`GFX_resize`/`GFX_clearAll`, `renderer.dst`, HUD, geometry/AV/variables, present, save-pairing —
happens on **MAIN**, in ring order. Rev-1's shortcut (CORE did the HUD blit + renderer setup +
resize) was the root of F1 and F5. This is the v2.4 contract taken literally.

## Work packages, revised (each finding folded in)

- **WP-A — input tick to MAIN + snapshots + service routing.**
  - Split `input_poll_callback` → `input_tick_main()` on MAIN; registered libretro callback is a
    no-op when `on_core`. (rev-1)
  - **F2 sleep flow:** `PWR_update` is NOT a plain MAIN move. MAIN detects the sleep request, then
    **park → drain → run autosave/memory-flush as CORE services → close audio only after park ack
    → stay QUIESCENT through sleep → resume audio on MAIN → release CORE.**
  - **F11 control snapshots:** carry `fast_forward` (and other per-epoch control flags) in the grant
    snapshot; do NOT read them live on CORE. Pack analog axes through `uint16_t` casts —
    left-shifting a negative signed axis is UB.
  - **F3 pacer + input latching:** MAIN must not free-spin when the pipeline is full (fc_pump
    returns immediately at depth≥2 — the D59 busy-spin, pipelined). Add a MAIN-owned grant cadence
    with a lifecycle-wakeable wait; **latch edge-triggered input until a grant succeeds** so a short
    press during a failed grant is never lost.

- **WP-B — immutable per-credit frame descriptor** (replaces rev-1's bare pool).
  - CORE copies pixels into the credit's buffer and publishes an **immutable** descriptor
    `{pixels, gen, width, height, pitch, format}`. MAIN owns renderer/scaler/`GFX_resize`/
    `GFX_clearAll`/HUD/dst/present. (**F1**)
  - **F6 DUP/NONE + multi-callback:** route NULL → `fc_signal_dup`; MAIN re-presents the MAIN-owned
    **last-presented** immutable frame for DUP/NONE. A retro_run that calls video_refresh multiple
    times needs per-published-frame storage or a specified coalescing+ack — one mutable buffer per
    epoch is insufficient.
  - **F12 failure paths:** validate depth∈{1,2}; validate dims/alloc sizes (checked multiply);
    allocate+verify all slots before enabling depth-2; never publish a stale/null slot; on OOM fall
    back to depth-1 through the depth-change gate.

- **WP-C — command channel** (NEW; the biggest rev-1 omission, **F5**).
  - Route `SET_SYSTEM_AV_INFO` / `SET_GEOMETRY` / `SET_VARIABLE` / `SHUTDOWN` / rumble through
    `FR_EV_CMD` (persistent/barrier as the design specifies); `zero_ftv2_drain` applies them on MAIN
    in order (it currently ignores FR_EV_CMD, minarch.c:5294). The libretro data pointer is
    transient → **deep-copy** the payload into the event. Shutdown/quit via an atomic/event, not a
    bare CORE-write/MAIN-read. Rumble via the contracted atomic handoff.

- **WP-D — governor + telemetry at depth-2** (NEW, **F4**).
  - Derive generation rate from **drained RUN_DONE** epochs, not loop/pump iterations. Publish CORE
    work through defined atomics/events. Replace the `thread_video` predicate (always 0 under
    guard-ON, so single-thread gov/DRC branches are wrongly selected) with an explicit v2
    depth/mode predicate. Reconcile with the v2.4 governor-ownership clause.

- **WP-E — audio lifecycle** (NEW, **F8**).
  - Make `SND_batchSamples` producer waits **park/stop-cancellable** with partial-accept, and
    propagate the shortfall into RUN_DONE (the framering already models `shortfall`). Always
    park-and-ack before any pause/close/resize/free of the audio device — otherwise the F2 sleep
    ordering can wedge park (CORE waiting on a full ring MAIN has stopped draining). The bounded
    audio lead itself is fine for bring-up; the cancellation/lifecycle gaps are the bug.

- **WP-F — save-state visual identity** (**F9**).
  - Keep a MAIN-owned **immutable last-presented** snapshot tagged with visual gen V. While parked,
    save the contractual pair `(state G, snapshot V)`. Add a terminal **save-and-quit** service path
    that does NOT release CORE or grant another epoch (rev-1's `fc_menu_op`-then-quit released
    RUNNING and could grant again before quit was seen).

- **WP-G — run signature** (**F10** — rev-1's TLS-stash cannot work; `zero_ftv2_run` never receives
  gen). Extend explicitly: `run(ctx, gen, slot, snapshot)` — pass the actual credit slot too, so
  minarch is not coupled to the `gen % depth` selection and needs no hidden TLS.

- **WP-C(enable) — unchanged in intent**, but default depth stays **1**; depth-2 is a guarded
  bring-up only; requalification gate precedes any auto-trial.

- **F7 (menu/disc F23):** valid but NOT a novel depth-2 blocker — depth-1 already calls
  `core.serialize` from MAIN during menu saves (shipped + on-device-validated), and `fc_park` fully
  quiesces CORE, so there is no concurrent access; only thread-identity differs, which our shipped
  cores don't care about in serialize. Fold the full service inventory in (memory flush, disc
  replace, controller change, save/load/reset, split MAIN screenshot/file work from CORE
  serialization) as **contract-hardening**, prioritized below F1–F6.

- **F13 (harness tests the glue):** the engine harness does not exercise minarch's renderer/input/
  audio/save/pool glue. Extract the shipping glue into a testable module (or compile the real
  callbacks/pool into a harness) and add the enumerated adversarial cases (pipeline-full-no-event,
  input edge with no credit, NULL/zero/multi-callback epochs, geometry/AV during N+1 while
  presenting N, normal+discard park with pool poisoning after credit return, save/load/reset/
  save-quit, sleep with a full audio ring, pool alloc/resize failure).

## Revised work-package verdict (accepting Codex's)

WP-A not sound until sleep-service + pacer + input-latch + control snapshots land. WP-B partially
sound (the raw credit-lifetime invariant holds; incomplete for renderer metadata / DUP-NONE /
multi-callback / last-presented / OOM). WP-C(enable) sound only as a guarded bring-up; depth-1 stays
the default. New WP-C(commands)/WP-D/WP-E/WP-F/WP-G are the added surface.

**Next process step:** iterate this to zero findings with a second Codex pass (as the v2.4 contract
did over 5 rounds) BEFORE writing code; the measurement A/B remains gated on Dan's save states.

---

## What is already reviewed vs. what is new (where to aim the review)  *(rev-1, superseded above)*

- **Already at zero findings** (do not re-review): the v2.4 ownership contract (5 Codex rounds),
  the framering protocol, and the frontend_core lifecycle engine. Depth-1 rode entirely on that
  surface and came up clean. The sanitizer harness (`run-frontend-core-tests.sh {plain,tsan,asan}`)
  tests the shipping engine, not a model.
- **New, un-reviewed surface = this doc**: the concrete **minarch** integration. Three work
  packages (WP-A input, WP-B frame, WP-C enable). All hazards live here, in the glue.

Key framing fact that shrinks the risk: **most of the depth-2 machinery already exists in-tree.**
- The framering already carries a **depth-sized** per-credit input snapshot (`snap[FR_MAX_DEPTH]`,
  lifetime grant→credit-return, framering.h:113) and a slot per grant (`grantq[].slot`). The F20
  "one snapshot slot per credit" design is **already implemented** — WP2 just delivers it to
  `run()`. No storage change.
- The core-touching shortcuts (save/load/reset) map onto service ops that **already exist**:
  `FC_OP_SERIALIZE` / `FC_OP_UNSERIALIZE` / `FC_OP_RESET` via `fc_menu_op` (park→service→release).
- Frame double-buffering already exists as a proven pattern: the dormant `thread_video` mailbox
  (`backbuffer` copy + `readybuffer`/`presentbuffer` swap, minarch.c:3307–3331, 5501–5532). Depth-2
  reuses the **copy-out-of-the-transient-core-framebuffer** idea, sized to credits instead of a
  latest-wins mailbox.

Under a guard-ON build, `ZERO_DISABLE_FRONTEND_THREADING` forces `thread_video=0` and locks the
Threading option (minarch.c:5433–5440), so the old mailbox path is **dormant, not deleted** — a
clean reference, zero interference.

---

## The depth-1 → depth-2 gap, precisely

Depth-1 is a **serial rendezvous**: `fc_pump` blocks for the epoch's RUN_DONE (D59), so MAIN is
idle while the CORE thread runs `core.run()` — including `input_poll_callback`, which today runs
**on the CORE thread**. Because there is no overlap, two shortcuts are safe *only serially*:

1. **Input** — `input_poll_callback` (minarch.c:1955) reads live globals (`buttons`, `pad`) and
   the CORE reads them back in `input_state_callback` (2085) during the same `core.run()`. Safe
   because MAIN never touches them concurrently.
2. **Frame** — the CORE-side `video_refresh` sets `renderer.src = data` (the core's *transient*
   internal framebuffer) and emits; MAIN's drain reads `renderer.src` and scales. Safe because the
   core cannot start the next epoch (and overwrite `data`) until MAIN releases the credit.

Depth-2 overlaps MAIN and CORE by design (CORE runs N+1 while MAIN presents N). Both shortcuts
then race. The three work packages remove each race.

---

## WP-A — move the input tick to MAIN; snapshot per epoch; route core ops through the service channel

**Problem.** `input_poll_callback` does far more than read buttons, and it currently runs on CORE.
Enumerated (minarch.c:1955–2084), with the depth-2 disposition of each:

| Work in `input_poll_callback` today | Depth-2 home | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `PAD_poll()` | **MAIN** | reads SDL/evdev — input source is MAIN-affine |
| `PWR_update(...)` (sleep, menu-before/after-sleep) | **MAIN** | power/sleep + SDL |
| MENU/PLUS/MINUS → `ignore_menu` | **MAIN** | menu state MAIN reads |
| BTN_POWER → `toggle_thread`/`was_threaded` | **MAIN** (dead under guard-ON: `thread_video==0`) | keep for parity |
| FF toggle / HOLD_FF → `setFastForward` | **MAIN** | `fast_forward` + audio lifecycle are MAIN's |
| CYCLE_SCALE / CYCLE_EFFECT → `Config_syncFrontend` | **MAIN** | frontend/display config |
| `SAVE_STATE` / `LOAD_STATE` → `Menu_save/loadState` | **CORE via `fc_menu_op(SERIALIZE/UNSERIALIZE)`** | calls `core.serialize/unserialize` — F23: only CORE enters the core |
| `RESET_GAME` → `core.reset()` | **CORE via `fc_menu_op(RESET)`** | enters the core |
| `SAVE_QUIT` → `Menu_saveState` + `quit=1` | **CORE service** (save) then MAIN sets quit | save enters the core |
| MENU release → `show_menu = 1` | **MAIN** | `show_menu` MAIN reads |
| compute `buttons` + read `pad.laxis/raxis` | **MAIN → the per-epoch snapshot** | this IS the input handed to the epoch |

**Design.**
- Extract the body of `input_poll_callback` into `input_tick_main()` and call it on MAIN, once per
  loop iteration, **before** the grant. The registered libretro `input_poll_callback` becomes a
  **no-op when `zero_ftv2_running && zero_ftv2_on_core`** (MAIN already did the work), else
  unchanged (guard-OFF and menu-redraw paths keep today's behavior).
- After `input_tick_main()`, MAIN packs the epoch input into the 4-word snapshot and passes it to
  `fc_pump` (replacing today's `snap[4]={0}`), e.g. `snap[0]=buttons`, `snap[1]=(laxis.x<<16)|
  (uint16)laxis.y`, `snap[2]=raxis`, `snap[3]` reserved. `fr_grant` stores it in the credit's slot
  (already depth-sized).
- `input_state_callback` (minarch.c:2085), when `zero_ftv2_running && zero_ftv2_on_core`, reads the
  **delivered snapshot** (WP2: `run(void*, const uint64_t snap[4])`) instead of the live globals.
  Mechanism: stash the delivered snapshot in a CORE-TLS (`static __thread uint64_t
  zero_ftv2_isnap[4]`) inside `zero_ftv2_run`, unpack in `input_state_callback`.
- The three core-touching shortcuts, detected on MAIN, issue `fc_menu_op` (park → service on CORE →
  release). This reuses the exact path menu save/load already takes. `SAVE_QUIT` = service-save then
  `quit=1`.

**What this costs / accepts.** Input is now `depth` epochs stale (~16 ms at depth 2) — **stated and
accepted** by the v2.4 F20 contract. Save/load/reset **park the pipeline** (drain + refill hitch),
identical to a menu visit — acceptable and already how menu ops behave.

**Edit sites:** `input_poll_callback` (split), `input_state_callback` (snapshot read), the run loop
at minarch.c:5485+ (call `input_tick_main`, pack snapshot, route shortcuts), `zero_ftv2_run` (stash
`isnap`).

## WP-B — per-credit frame buffers (stop reading the core's transient framebuffer)

**Problem.** At depth-2 the CORE overwrites its internal framebuffer (`data`) on epoch N+1 while
MAIN is still scaling frame N from `renderer.src = data`. Tearing / use-after-overwrite.

**Design (credit-indexed pool, reusing the mailbox copy pattern):**
- The CORE owns a pool of **`depth`** RGB565 buffers (allocate/resize with the existing
  `backbuffer` logic, minarch.c:3309–3318). In the CORE-side `video_refresh` (after the HUD blit,
  which must stay on the producing thread since it writes into the frame), `memcpy` `data →
  pool[gen % depth]`, then `fc_emit_frame(&zero_ftv2, gen % depth)` — the previously-unused `payload`
  carries the slot.
- MAIN's drain, on `FR_EV_FRAME`, sets `renderer.src = pool[ev->payload]` (or `pool[ev->seq %
  depth]` — `ev->seq` already carries the epoch gen, framering.h:59), then `GFX_blitRenderer` +
  `GFX_flip`. The scaler's destination is `screen->pixels`, **MAIN-owned and single** — no
  double-buffer needed there; only the raw pool needs slots.
- Credit accounting bounds outstanding epochs to `depth`, so `pool[gen % depth]` is never reused
  while MAIN still needs it (same invariant that protects `snap[]`).
- The CORE needs its epoch gen to index the pool. `fr_core_wait_grant` returns `gen`; stash it in a
  CORE-TLS (`zero_ftv2_slot`) in `zero_ftv2_run` alongside `isnap`. **Open question for review:**
  prefer passing `gen` into the `run()` vtable signature vs. a CORE-TLS stash (see hazards).

**Edit sites:** `video_refresh_callback_main` (pool copy + emit slot, minarch.c:3196–3303),
`zero_ftv2_drain` (read `pool[slot]`, minarch.c:5286), pool alloc/resize, `zero_ftv2_run` (stash
slot).

## WP-C — enable depth 2 (fixed first, auto-trial later)

- **Stage 1 (this bring-up):** force depth via env `ZERO_FTV2_DEPTH` (default 1), read in
  `fc_init(&zero_ftv2, &zero_ftv2_vt, depth)`. `fc_pump` at depth ≥ 2 already keeps
  grant+prefix-drain+return (no block — D59). This validates **correctness** of the pipeline
  (picture/sound/input) before any decision logic.
- **Stage 2 (later, separate):** wire the observe→trial→verdict→sidecar machinery onto
  `fc_set_depth` (the transition gate reclaims credits safely, F24). The design's requalification
  gate (first 60 frames after load run depth 1) belongs here, not in Stage 1.

Non-goals for depth-2: user-facing toggle, depth > 2, auto-trial in Stage 1 (v2.4 §out-of-scope).

## Open hazards / questions for the reviewer

1. **`gen` to the CORE video_refresh** — CORE-TLS stash vs. extending the `run()` signature to
   `run(void* c, uint64_t gen, const uint64_t snap[4])`. TLS is less churn; explicit is cleaner.
   Which?
2. **`downsample` global `buffer`** (minarch.c:3281–3284) — the downsample path writes a *shared*
   global and points `renderer.src` at it. At depth-2 this races. Fix: downsample into `pool[slot]`
   (fold into the WP-B copy) or per-slot downsample buffers. Confirm no other reader of `buffer`.
3. **HUD blit reads governor globals** (`gov_state`, `cpu_double`, minarch.c:3272) on the CORE
   thread while MAIN's governor writes them — benign text-only races (garbled digit at worst).
   Accept, or snapshot the HUD inputs at grant?
4. **`fast_forward`** — written on MAIN (FF toggle), read on CORE in `audio_sample_callback`
   (minarch.c:3337) to gate audio emission. Torn read = one frame's audio wrongly emitted/dropped
   on an FF flip. Accept, or carry FF in the per-epoch snapshot?
5. **`last_flip_time`** (minarch.c:3302) and other callback-written globals — audit thread owner
   under depth-2 (which thread's clock drives pacing/governor).
6. **Audio ownership at depth-2** — `audio_sample_batch_callback` still emits from CORE (unchanged
   from depth-1); confirm the SND ring + F5 audio-ownership contract hold when CORE runs ahead of
   MAIN's present by up to `depth` epochs (audio-vs-video skew ≤ depth epochs).
7. **Menu/park during a pipelined epoch** — `fc_park` (loop at minarch.c:5548) must reclaim *all*
   outstanding credits and drain the pool; verify no in-flight `pool[slot]` is presented after
   park. (Gate F24 should cover this; confirm against the pool.)

---

## Validation plan

1. **Harness first (no device):** extend `frontend_core_test.c` to run adversarial sessions at
   **depth 2** with a frame-pool + snapshot oracle: assert MAIN presents `pool[N]`'s content while
   CORE produces N+1 (no overwrite), and that each epoch's `input_state` reads its own snapshot
   (extends INV16 to the pipelined case). Plain/TSan/ASan all green — TSan is the real gate for the
   new overlap.
2. **On-device bring-up (with Dan):** `ZERO_FTV2_DEPTH=2`, one clean single-process instance
   (reboot first — there are currently stacked `minui.elf` procs). Verify per game: picture, sound,
   **input responsiveness** (the ~16 ms lag is expected; confirm playable), menu in/out, save/load/
   reset, FF. SNES first (the beneficiary).
3. **The measurement (gated on Dan's save states):** depth-1 vs depth-2 energy A/B at demanding
   scenes — DKC (mine-cart/boss), Yoshi's Island (Super-FX2 rotate/scale boss), Mario RPG (SA-1
   battle). Save states do not yet exist and **block this step**; the code above is validatable to
   "runs correctly pipelined" without them.

## One-line summary for the reviewer

Depth-2 = (A) move the input tick to MAIN + per-epoch snapshot + route save/load/reset through the
existing service ops; (B) copy each frame into a credit-indexed pool so MAIN never reads the core's
transient buffer; (C) flip depth to 2 (fixed for bring-up, auto-trial later). Almost every
primitive already exists and is reviewed; the risk is entirely in the minarch glue enumerated here.
