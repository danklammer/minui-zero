# NextUI thermal/CPU-governor comparison

Researched 2026-06-30 from the `nextui` remote (LoveRetro/NextUI) — release notes, PR #695,
and their shipped `governor.sh`. Goal: find NextUI's documented thermal benchmarks and compare
their CPU-scaling design against ours.

## The benchmark number you remembered
NextUI does **not** publish a formal temperature table. Their numbers live in two places:
1. **A runtime debug HUD** — v2.5.1 (2025-03-24) "Added cpu temperature in celsius to debug HUD".
2. **PR #695** (merged v6.11.0, 2026-05-14, "Replace userspace CPU governor with kernel scaling
   governors", by pvaibhav). The money quote:

   > "the biggest positive impact of this PR is significant reduction in CPU usage by the
   > userspace governor thread and correspondingly **significant reduction in core temperature
   > of the order of 5–10°C**."

That 5–10°C is the headline figure — and it comes from the **same change we made**: dropping the
`userspace` governor + `scaling_setspeed` pin (whose polling thread itself burned CPU/heat) in
favor of kernel scaling governors.

## NextUI's shipped design (their `governor.sh`, v6.11.x)
Reads `scaling_available_frequencies` live; three modes:
| Mode | Kernel governor | Range (TG5040) |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **auto** | `schedutil` | 408 → **1800** (second_max = one step below the 2000 OC) |
| **performance** | `performance` | 408 → **2000** (they *do* expose the 2.0GHz OC here) |
| **powersave** | `conservative` | 408 → 1200 (midpoint) |
- Author's philosophy: *"there should not be any need for any option except Auto and at best a
  Powersave mode → that is how our phones and laptops work."* No frame-aware closed loop at all.
- Their auto restores on minarch exit; `PLAT_setCPUSpeed` became a no-op.
- Follow-up v6.11.1 "fix: slowdowns on Auto cpu speed" (PR #727) — they hit tuning pain too.

## How we compare
| | NextUI auto | Ours (measured on-device, Tony Hawk PS1) |
|---|---|---|
| Governor | schedutil | schedutil (hybrid) |
| Floor | 408 | 408 (just corrected from assumed 480) |
| Cap | 1800 global (every system) | **per-system** (PS1 1800, 16-bit 1416, 8-bit 1008) |
| 2.0GHz OC | exposed in Performance mode | **never** (thesis: no overclock) |
| Frame-aware loop | none | built, but **not firing** on-device (ceiling never sinks below f_max) |
| Result | "5–10°C cooler" vs old userspace | 36–37°C sustained PS1; schedutil self-scaled 816–1608 |

## Three-way comparison: original MinUI vs NextUI vs ours
Original MinUI (`upstream/main`) uses the **userspace** governor with a **static pin**: MENU 600 /
POWERSAVE 1200 / **NORMAL 1608 (the default — `minarch_cpu_speed .default_value = 1`)** / PERFORMANCE
2000. No dynamic scaling — it holds the pinned clock through idle, menus, and light scenes alike.

| | Original MinUI | NextUI v6.11+ | Ours |
|---|----------------|---------------|------|
| Mechanism | userspace **static pin** | `schedutil` auto | `schedutil` + per-system cap + frame loop |
| Default gameplay clock | **1608 flat** | dynamic 408–1800 | dynamic 408–[per-system cap] |
| 2.0GHz OC | opt-in "Performance" | opt-in "Performance" mode | **never** |
| Scales down when idle/light | **no** (stays pinned) | yes | yes |

**Measured on-device (settled CPU temp, TrimUI Brick, 2026-06-30):**
| Game | Ours (schedutil) | MinUI default (1608 pin) | MinUI Perf / old (2000 pin) |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| NES 1942     | 600 MHz · **39°C** | 1608 · **42°C** | 2000 · **44°C** |
| PS1 Tony Hawk| 1416 · **38°C**    | 1608 · **40°C** | 2000 · **42°C** |

- **vs original MinUI:** **2–3°C cooler than its 1608 default, 4–5°C cooler than 2000 Performance** —
  and structurally more efficient: MinUI pins 1608 even for NES and during idle/menus, where we drop
  to 600. That standing-power gap is larger than the temp delta suggests and the static pin can't close it.
- **vs NextUI:** **a thermal tie** — NextUI's `auto` *is* `schedutil` 408–1800, the same mechanism we
  measured, so its temps track ours (~38–39°C). (Inferred from their `governor.sh`, not separately
  flashed.) Our differences are philosophy, not degrees: per-system caps (they cap everything at 1800),
  never exposing the 2.0 OC, and staying pure-software RGB565 (NextUI adds GL/GPU features we omit).

## The two findings that matter
1. **Independent convergence = strong validation.** Two forks, arrived separately at the identical
   core: *schedutil + range-limit, floor 408, cap one step below the 2.0 OC.* We're on the right road.
2. **Our closed-loop ceiling controller currently adds nothing over plain schedutil.** On-device the
   ceiling pins at f_max the whole session; schedutil does all the real scaling underneath. NextUI
   deliberately shipped *without* such a loop and still got the 5–10°C win. So our decision point:
   - **(a)** Debug/tune the frame-aware sink so it demonstrably beats plain schedutil, **or**
   - **(b)** Lean into schedutil + **per-system ranges** (our real edge — NextUI caps *everything* at
     1800; we cap an 8-bit game's schedutil at 1008, which should run cooler than NextUI on light
     systems) and treat the closed loop as optional.

   (b) fits the "stay lean / runs cold" thesis and is already half-built (per-system f_max is applied
   statically at game load). Our differentiator is **per-system caps**, not the bespoke controller.

## On-device A/B result (measured 2026-06-30, same game each run, only clock policy differs)
Method: `GOV_DISABLE=1` + `userspace`@2000000 reproduces the old MinUI pin; schedutil is our governor.
Settled CPU temp after ~70s.

| Game (load) | schedutil (ours) | pinned 2.0GHz (old) | Δ |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|---|
| NES 1942 (light)        | ~600 MHz · 39°C  | 2000 MHz · 44°C | **5°C cooler** |
| PS1 Tony Hawk (heavy)   | 1416 MHz · 38°C  | 2000 MHz · 42°C | **4°C cooler** |

**Reproduces NextUI's 5–10°C on our own fork** (~4–5°C, low end). The delta is essentially the
schedutil-vs-userspace-pin win we *and* NextUI share; per-system caps + the closed loop sit on top.

### Corrected insight: the governor saves MOST on light games, not heavy ones
An earlier note here guessed a heavier game would widen the gap toward 10°C. The PS1 run disproved
it: the gap *narrowed* (4°C vs NES's 5°C). Reason — the pin wastes the most where the game needs the
least. schedutil cuts NES 3.3× below the pin (2000→600) but PS1 only 1.4× (2000→1416, it genuinely
needs the clock). So the efficiency win scales with how *little* a system demands.

### Honest measurement caveats
Absolute temps sit in a narrow 37–44°C band — at this ambient the baseline (display/SoC/wifi-for-SSH)
dominates and emulation adds only a few °C; even the "bad" 2.0 pin never got hot here. The 4-vs-5°C
difference is within single-run sensor/thermal-drift noise; the robust takeaways are the **~4–5°C
magnitude** and the **light-saves-more direction**. The bigger thermal story would show under
sustained load in a warm/enclosed environment. On this bench, the win is mostly efficiency/battery
and headroom, not overheating-avoidance.

## Correction to an earlier read: the closed-loop ceiling DOES fire
On Tony Hawk (PS1) the ceiling held at f_max, which first looked like the sink branch was dead. The
NES run disproved that: the ceiling actively sank toward the 408 floor (408–624 kHz, below the 1008
cap) because a trivial load has zero frame pressure — while PS1 correctly held high for real demand.
So the frame-aware loop works as designed. Its *marginal* benefit over plain schedutil is still open
(schedutil already runs light loads low), but it is not inert. Per-system static caps remain the
clearest, cheapest edge over NextUI's single global 1800 cap.
